## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I completed this project during my early stages of learning web development. The primary challenge I encountered was placing items accurately in their designated locations. At the time, I had not yet familiarized myself with the concepts of flex and grid. Consequently, I relied heavily on absolute positioning, which resulted in a messy codebase. Through this project, I gained valuable insights into positioning techniques, including how to leverage flex and grid effectively. Additionally, I acquired knowledge on media queries and creating responsive websites. Despite the steep learning curve, I found the project highly engaging. To improve the codebase, I made a few modifications to enhance readability and responsiveness. Specifically, I eliminated all instances of absolute positioning.


### Continued development

I do not intend to make any further additions to this project as I believe it is complete, and I am satisfied with the outcome. I am committed to advancing my skills and knowledge by embarking on new projects and honing my abilities.
